# terraform-provider-netbox

The Terraform Netbox provider is a plugin for Terraform that allows for the full lifecycle management of [Netbox](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) resources.
This provider is maintained by E. Breuninger.

See: [Official documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/e-breuninger/netbox/latest/docs) in the Terraform registry.

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 0.12.x
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.14

## Supported netbox versions
Netbox often makes breaking API changes even in non-major releases. Check the table below to see which version a provider was tested against. It is generally recommended to use the provider version matching your Netbox version. We aim to always support the latest minor version of Netbox.

Since version [1.6.6](https://github.com/e-breuninger/terraform-provider-netbox/commit/0b0b2fffa54d4ab2e5f1677e948b01e56ba211c8), each version of the provider has a built-in list of all Netbox versions it supports at release time. Upon initialization, the provider will probe your Netbox version and include a (non-blocking) warning if the used Netbox version is not supported.

Provider version | Netbox version
--- | ---
v2.0.x | v3.2.0 and up
v1.6.x and up| v3.1.9
v1.1.x and up | v3.1.3
v1.0.x | v3.0.9
v0.3.x | v2.11.12
v0.2.x | v2.10.10
v0.1.x | v2.9
v0.0.x | v2.9

## Building The Provider

1. Clone the repository
1. Enter the repository directory
1. Build the provider using the Go `install` command:

```sh
$ go install
```

## Installation

Starting with Terraform 0.13, you can download the provider via the Terraform registry.

For further information on how to use third party providers, see the [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html)

Releases for all major plattforms are available on the release page.

## Using the provider

Here is a short example on how to use this provider:

```hcl
provider "netbox" {
  server_url = "https://demo.netbox.dev"
  api_token  = "<your api token>"
}

resource "netbox_platform" "testplatform" {
  name = "my-test-platform"
}
```

For a more complex example, see the `example` folder.

## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (see [Requirements](#requirements) above).

To compile the provider, run `go install`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

To generate or update documentation, run `go generate`.

In order to run the suite of unit tests, run `make test`.

In order to run the full suite of acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

_Note:_ Acceptance tests create a docker compose stack on port 8001.

```sh
$ make testacc
```
If you notice a failed test, it might be due to a stale netbox data volume.  Before concluding there is a problem, 
refresh the docker containers by running `docker-compose down --volumes` in the `docker` directory. Then run the tests again.

If you get `too many open files` errors when running the acceptance test suite locally on Linux, your user limit for open file descriptors might be too low. You can increase that limit with `ulimit -n 2048`.
