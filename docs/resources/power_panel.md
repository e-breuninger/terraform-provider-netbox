  From the official documentation https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/models/dcim/powerpanel/:
  A power panel represents the origin point in NetBox for electrical power being disseminated by one or more power feeds. In a data center environment, one power panel often serves a group of racks, with an individual power feed extending to each rack, though this is not always the case. It is common to have two sets of panels and feeds arranged in parallel to provide redundant power to each rack.
