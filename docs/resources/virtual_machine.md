  From the official documentation https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/features/virtualization/#virtual-machines:
  A virtual machine is a virtualized compute instance. These behave in NetBox very similarly to device objects, but without any physical attributes. For example, a VM may have interfaces assigned to it with IP addresses and VLANs, however its interfaces cannot be connected via cables (because they are virtual). Each VM may also define its compute, memory, and storage resources as well.

# netbox_virtual_machine (Resource)

From the [official documentation](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/features/virtualization/#virtual-machines):

> A virtual machine is a virtualized compute instance. These behave in NetBox very similarly to device objects, but without any physical attributes. For example, a VM may have interfaces assigned to it with IP addresses and VLANs, however its interfaces cannot be connected via cables (because they are virtual).

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Assumes vmw-cluster-01 exists in Netbox
data "netbox_cluster" "vmw_cluster_01" {
  name = "vmw-cluster-01"
}

resource "netbox_virtual_machine" "base_vm" {
  cluster_id = data.netbox_cluster.vmw_cluster_01.id
  name       = "myvm-1"
}
// Assumes vmw-cluster-01 exists in Netbox
data "netbox_cluster" "vmw_cluster_01" {
  name = "vmw-cluster-01"
}

resource "netbox_virtual_machine" "basic_vm" {
  cluster_id   = data.netbox_cluster.vmw_cluster_01.id
  name         = "myvm-2"
  disk_size_gb = 40
  memory_mb    = 4092
  vcpus        = "2"
}
// Assumes vmw-cluster-01 exists as a cluster in Netbox
data "netbox_cluster" "vmw_cluster_01" {
  name = "vmw-cluster-01"
}

// Assumes customer-a exists as a tenant in Netbox
data "netbox_tenant" "customer_a" {
  name = "Customer A"
}

resource "netbox_virtual_machine" "full_vm" {
  cluster_id   = data.netbox_cluster.vmw_cluster_01.id
  name         = "myvm-3"
  disk_size_gb = 40
  memory_mb    = 4092
  vcpus        = "2"
  role_id      = 31 // This corresponds to the Netbox ID for a given role
  tenant_id    = data.netbox_tenant.customer_a.id
  local_context_data = jsonencode({
    "setting_a" = "Some Setting"
    "setting_b" = 42
  })
}
