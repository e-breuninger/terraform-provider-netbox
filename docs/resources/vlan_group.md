# netbox_vlan_group (Resource)

From the [official documentation](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/features/vlans/#vlans):

> A VLAN represents an isolated layer two domain, identified by a name and a numeric ID (1-4094) as defined in IEEE 802.1Q. VLANs are arranged into VLAN groups to define scope and to enforce uniqueness.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "netbox_vlan_group" "example1" {
  name = "VLAN Group 1"
  min_vid  = "777"
  max_vid  = "1777"
  tags = []
}

# Assume netbox_site resource exists
resource "netbox_vlan_group" "example2" {
  name        = "VLAN Group 2"
  min_vid         = "778"
  max_vid         = "1778"
  status      = "reserved"
  description = "Site-specific VLAN Group"
  scope_type = "dcim.site"
  scope_id     = netbox_site.ex.id
  tags        = [netbox_tag.ex.name]
