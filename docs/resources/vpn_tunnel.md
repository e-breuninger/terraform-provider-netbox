  From the official documentation https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/features/vpn-tunnels/:
  NetBox can model private tunnels formed among virtual termination points across your network. Typical tunnel implementations include GRE, IP-in-IP, and IPSec. A tunnel may be terminated to two or more device or virtual machine interfaces. For convenient organization, tunnels may be assigned to user-defined groups.

# netbox_vpn_tunnel (Resource)

From the [official documentation](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/features/vpn-tunnels/):

> NetBox can model private tunnels formed among virtual termination points across your network. Typical tunnel implementations include GRE, IP-in-IP, and IPSec. A tunnel may be terminated to two or more device or virtual machine interfaces. For convenient organization, tunnels may be assigned to user-defined groups.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "netbox_vpn_tunnel_group" "test" {
  name = "my-tunnel-group"
}

resource "netbox_vpn_tunnel" "test" {
  name            = "my-tunnel"
  encapsulation   = "ipsec-transport"
  status          = "active"
  tunnel_group_id = netbox_vpn_tunnel_group.test.id

  description = "This is a description."
  tunnel_id   = 3
  tenant_id   = 2
}
```
