  From the official documentation https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/features/sites-and-racks/#regions:
  Sites can be arranged geographically using regions. A region might represent a continent, country, city, campus, or other area depending on your use case. Regions can be nested recursively to construct a hierarchy. For example, you might define several country regions, and within each of those several state or city regions to which sites are assigned.
  Each region must have a name that is unique within its parent region, if any.
