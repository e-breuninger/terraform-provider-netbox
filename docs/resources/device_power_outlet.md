  From the official documentation https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/models/dcim/poweroutlet/:
  Power outlets represent the outlets on a power distribution unit (PDU) or other device that supplies power to dependent devices. Each power port may be assigned a physical type, and may be associated with a specific feed leg (where three-phase power is used) and/or a specific upstream power port. This association can be used to model the distribution of power within a device.
  For example, imagine a PDU with one power port which draws from a three-phase feed and 48 power outlets arranged into three banks of 16 outlets each. Outlets 1-16 would be associated with leg A on the port, and outlets 17-32 and 33-48 would be associated with legs B and C, respectively.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Note that some terraform code is not included in the example for brevity

resource "netbox_device" "test" {
  name           = "%[1]s"
  device_type_id = netbox_device_type.test.id
  role_id        = netbox_device_role.test.id
  site_id        = netbox_site.test.id
}

resource "netbox_device_power_outlet" "test" {
  device_id = netbox_device.test.id
  name      = "power outlet"
  type      = "iec-60320-c5"
  feed_leg  = "A"
}
