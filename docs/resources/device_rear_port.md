  From the official documentation https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/models/dcim/rearport/:
  Like front ports, rear ports are pass-through ports which represent the continuation of a path from one cable to the next. Each rear port is defined with its physical type and a number of positions: Rear ports with more than one position can be mapped to multiple front ports. This can be useful for modeling instances where multiple paths share a common cable (for example, six discrete two-strand fiber connections sharing a 12-strand MPO cable).

# netbox_device_rear_port (Resource)

From the [official documentation](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/models/dcim/rearport/):

> Like front ports, rear ports are pass-through ports which represent the continuation of a path from one cable to the next. Each rear port is defined with its physical type and a number of positions: Rear ports with more than one position can be mapped to multiple front ports. This can be useful for modeling instances where multiple paths share a common cable (for example, six discrete two-strand fiber connections sharing a 12-strand MPO cable).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Note that some terraform code is not included in the example for brevity

resource "netbox_device" "test" {
  name           = "%[1]s"
  device_type_id = netbox_device_type.test.id
  role_id        = netbox_device_role.test.id
  site_id        = netbox_site.test.id
}

resource "netbox_device_rear_port" "test" {
  device_id      = netbox_device.test.id
  name           = "rear port 1"
  type           = "8p8c"
  positions      = 2
  mark_connected = true
}
```
