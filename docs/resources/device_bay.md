  From the official documentation https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/models/dcim/devicebay/:
  Device bays represent a space or slot within a device in which a field-replaceable device may be installed. A common example is that of a chassis-based server that holds a number of blades which may contain device components that don't fit the module pattern. Devices in turn hold additional components that become available to the parent device.

# netbox_device_bay (Resource)

From the [official documentation](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/models/dcim/devicebay/):

> Device bays represent a space or slot within a device in which a field-replaceable device may be installed. A common example is that of a chassis-based server that holds a number of blades which may contain device components that don't fit the module pattern. Devices in turn hold additional components that become available to the parent device.

## Example Usage

```terraform

  name = "example_tenant"
}

resource "netbox_site" "example" {
  name   = "example_site"
  status = "active"
}

resource "netbox_manufacturer" "example" {
  name = "example_manufacturer"
}

resource "netbox_device_type" "example" {
  model           = "example_device_type"
  manufacturer_id = netbox_manufacturer.example.id
  subdevice_role  = "parent"
}

resource "netbox_device_type" "example_installed" {
  model           = "example_device_type_installed"
  manufacturer_id = netbox_manufacturer.example.id
  u_height        = 0
  subdevice_role  = "child"
}

resource "netbox_device_role" "example" {
  name      = "example_role"
  color_hex = "123456"
}

resource "netbox_device" "example" {
  name           = "example_device"
  device_type_id = netbox_device_type.example.id
