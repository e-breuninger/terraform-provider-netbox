  From the official documentation https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/models/dcim/devicebay/:
  Device bays represent a space or slot within a device in which a field-replaceable device may be installed. A common example is that of a chassis-based server that holds a number of blades which may contain device components that don't fit the module pattern. Devices in turn hold additional components that become available to the parent device.

# netbox_device_bay (Resource)

From the [official documentation](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/models/dcim/devicebay/):

> Device bays represent a space or slot within a device in which a field-replaceable device may be installed. A common example is that of a chassis-based server that holds a number of blades which may contain device components that don't fit the module pattern. Devices in turn hold additional components that become available to the parent device.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "netbox_tenant" "test" {
  name = "%[1]s"
}

resource "netbox_site" "test" {
  name = "%[1]s"
  status = "active"
}

resource "netbox_manufacturer" "test" {
  name = "%[1]s"
}

resource "netbox_device_type" "test" {
  model = "%[1]s"
  manufacturer_id = netbox_manufacturer.test.id
  subdevice_role = "parent"
}

resource "netbox_device_type" "test_installed" {
  model = "%[1]s_installed"
  manufacturer_id = netbox_manufacturer.test.id
  u_height = 0
  subdevice_role = "child"
}

resource "netbox_device_role" "test" {
  name = "%[1]s"
  color_hex = "123456"
}

resource "netbox_device" "test" {
  name = "%[1]s"
  device_type_id = netbox_device_type.test.id
  tenant_id = netbox_tenant.test.id
  role_id = netbox_device_role.test.id
  site_id = netbox_site.test.id
}

resource "netbox_device" "test_installed" {
  name = "%[1]s_installed"
  device_type_id = netbox_device_type.test_installed.id
  tenant_id = netbox_tenant.test.id
  role_id = netbox_device_role.test.id
  site_id = netbox_site.test.id
}

resource "netbox_device_bay" "test" {
  device_id = netbox_device.test.id
  name = "%[1]s"
