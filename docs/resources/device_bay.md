  From the official documentation https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/models/dcim/devicebay/:
  Device bays represent a space or slot within a device in which a field-replaceable device may be installed. A common example is that of a chassis-based server that holds a number of blades which may contain device components that don't fit the module pattern. Devices in turn hold additional components that become available to the parent device.
