  From the official documentation https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/features/ipam/#ip-addresses:
  An IP address comprises a single host address (either IPv4 or IPv6) and its subnet mask. Its mask should match exactly how the IP address is configured on an interface in the real world.
  Like a prefix, an IP address can optionally be assigned to a VRF (otherwise, it will appear in the "global" table). IP addresses are automatically arranged under parent prefixes within their respective VRFs according to the IP hierarchy.

# netbox_ip_address (Resource)

From the [official documentation](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/features/ipam/#ip-addresses):

> An IP address comprises a single host address (either IPv4 or IPv6) and its subnet mask. Its mask should match exactly how the IP address is configured on an interface in the real world.

## Example Usage

### Creating an IP address that is assigned to a virtual machine interface

Starting with provider version 3.5.0, you can use the `virtual_machine_interface_id` attribute to assign an IP address to a virtual machine interface.
You can also use the `interface_id` and `object_type` attributes instead.

With `virtual_machine_interface_id`:
```terraform
// Assuming a virtual machine with the id `123` exists
resource "netbox_interface" "this" {
  name               = "eth0"
  virtual_machine_id = 123
}

resource "netbox_ip_address" "this" {
  ip_address                   = "10.0.0.60/24"
  status                       = "active"
  virtual_machine_interface_id = netbox_interface.this.id
}
```

With `object_type` and `interface_id`:
```terraform
// Assuming a virtual machine with the id `123` exists
resource "netbox_interface" "this" {
  name               = "eth0"
  virtual_machine_id = 123
}

resource "netbox_ip_address" "this" {
  ip_address   = "10.0.0.60/24"
  status       = "active"
  interface_id = netbox_interface.this.id
  object_type  = "virtualization.vminterface"
}
```

### Creating an IP address that is assigned to a device interface

Starting with provider version 3.5.0, you can use the `device_interface_id` attribute to assign an IP address to a device interface.
You can also use the `interface_id` and `object_type` attributes instead.

With `device_interface_id`:
```terraform
// Assuming a device with the id `123` exists
resource "netbox_device_interface" "this" {
  name      = "eth0"
  device_id = 123
  type      = "1000base-t"
}

resource "netbox_ip_address" "this" {
  ip_address          = "10.0.0.60/24"
  status              = "active"
  device_interface_id = netbox_device_interface.this.id
}
```

With `object_type` and `interface_id`:
```terraform
// Assuming a device with the id `123` exists
resource "netbox_device_interface" "this" {
  name      = "eth0"
  device_id = 123
  type      = "1000base-t"
}

resource "netbox_ip_address" "this" {
  ip_address   = "10.0.0.60/24"
  status       = "active"
  interface_id = netbox_device_interface.this.id
  object_type  = "dcim.interface"
}
```

### Creating an IP address that is not assigned to anything

You can create an IP address that is not assigend to anything by omitting the attributes mentioned above.

```terraform
resource "netbox_ip_address" "this" {
  ip_address = "10.0.0.50/24"
  status     = "reserved"
}
```
