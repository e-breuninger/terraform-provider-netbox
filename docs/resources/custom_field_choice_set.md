# netbox_custom_field_choice_set (Resource)

From the [official documentation](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/models/extras/customfieldchoiceset/):

A choice set must define a base choice set and/or a set of arbitrary extra choices.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "netbox_custom_field_choice_set" "test" {
  name        = "my-custom-field-set"
  description = "Description"
  extra_choices = [
    ["choice1", "label1"], # label and choice are different
    ["choice2", "choice2"] # label and choice are the same
  ]
}
```
