  From the official documentation https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/models/dcim/moduletype/:
  A module type represents a specific make and model of hardware component which is installable within a device's module bay and has its own child components. For example, consider a chassis-based switch or router with a number of field-replaceable line cards. Each line card has its own model number and includes a certain set of components such as interfaces. Each module type may have a manufacturer, model number, and part number assigned to it.
