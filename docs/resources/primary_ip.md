}

resource "netbox_interface" "myvm_eth0" {
  name               = "eth0"
  virtual_machine_id = data.netbox_virtual_machine.myvm.id
}

resource "netbox_ip_address" "myvm_ip" {
  ip_address   = "10.0.0.60/24"
  status       = "active"
  interface_id = netbox_interface.myvm_eth0.id
}

resource "netbox_primary_ip" "myvm_primary_ip" {
  ip_address_id      = netbox_ip_address.myvm_ip.id
