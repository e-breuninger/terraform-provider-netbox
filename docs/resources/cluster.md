  From the official documentation https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/features/virtualization/#clusters:
  A cluster is a logical grouping of physical resources within which virtual machines run. A cluster must be assigned a type (technological classification), and may optionally be assigned to a cluster group, site, and/or tenant. Each cluster must have a unique name within its assigned group and/or site, if any.
  Physical devices may be associated with clusters as hosts. This allows users to track on which host(s) a particular virtual machine may reside. However, NetBox does not support pinning a specific VM within a cluster to a particular host device.

# netbox_cluster (Resource)

From the [official documentation](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/features/virtualization/#clusters):

> A cluster is a logical grouping of physical resources within which virtual machines run. A cluster must be assigned a type (technological classification), and may optionally be assigned to a cluster group, site, and/or tenant. Each cluster must have a unique name within its assigned group and/or site, if any.

> Physical devices may be associated with clusters as hosts. This allows users to track on which host(s) a particular virtual machine may reside. However, NetBox does not support pinning a specific VM within a cluster to a particular host device.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Assumes the 'dc-west' cluster group already exists
data "netbox_cluster_group" "dc_west" {
  name = "dc-west"
}

resource "netbox_cluster_type" "vmw_vsphere" {
  name = "VMware vSphere 6"
}

resource "netbox_cluster" "vmw_cluster_01" {
  cluster_type_id  = netbox_cluster_type.vmw_vsphere.id
  name             = "vmw-cluster-01"
  cluster_group_id = data.netbox_cluster_group.dc_west.id
}
```
