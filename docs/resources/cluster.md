# netbox_cluster (Resource)

From the [official documentation](https://netboxlabs.com/docs/netbox/models/virtualization/cluster/):
> A cluster is a logical grouping of physical resources within which virtual machines run. Physical devices may be associated with clusters as hosts. This allows users to track on which host(s) a particular virtual machine may reside.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Assumes the 'dc-west' cluster group already exists
data "netbox_cluster_group" "dc_west" {
  name = "dc-west"
}

resource "netbox_cluster_type" "vmw_vsphere" {
  name = "VMware vSphere 6"
}

resource "netbox_cluster" "vmw_cluster_01" {
  cluster_type_id  = netbox_cluster_type.vmw_vsphere.id
  name             = "vmw-cluster-01"
  cluster_group_id = data.netbox_cluster_group.dc_west.id
}
```
