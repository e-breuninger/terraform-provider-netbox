  From the official documentation https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/features/ipam/#virtual-routing-and-forwarding-vrf:
  A VRF object in NetBox represents a virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) domain. Each VRF is essentially a separate routing table. VRFs are commonly used to isolate customers or organizations from one another within a network, or to route overlapping address space (e.g. multiple instances of the 10.0.0.0/8 space). Each VRF may be assigned to a specific tenant to aid in organizing the available IP space by customer or internal user.
