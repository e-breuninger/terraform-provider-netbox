  From the official documentation https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/features/sites-and-racks/#sites:
  How you choose to employ sites when modeling your network may vary depending on the nature of your organization, but generally a site will equate to a building or campus. For example, a chain of banks might create a site to represent each of its branches, a site for its corporate headquarters, and two additional sites for its presence in two colocation facilities.
  Each site must be assigned a unique name and may optionally be assigned to a region and/or tenant.
