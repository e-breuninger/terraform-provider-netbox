  From the official documentation https://netboxlabs.com/docs/netbox/models/dcim/macaddress/:
  A MAC address object in NetBox comprises a single Ethernet link layer address, and represents a MAC address as reported by or assigned to a network interface. MAC addresses can be assigned to device and virtual machine interfaces. A MAC address can be specified as the primary MAC address for a given device or VM interface.

# netbox_mac_address (Resource)

From the [official documentation](https://netboxlabs.com/docs/netbox/models/dcim/macaddress/):

> A MAC address object in NetBox comprises a single Ethernet link layer address, and represents a MAC address as reported by or assigned to a network interface. MAC addresses can be assigned to device and virtual machine interfaces. A MAC address can be specified as the primary MAC address for a given device or VM interface.

## Example Usage

### Creating a MAC address that is assigned to a virtual machine interface

With `virtual_machine_interface_id`:
```terraform
// Assuming a virtual machine with the id `123` exists
resource "netbox_interface" "this" {
  name               = "eth0"
  virtual_machine_id = 123
}

resource "netbox_mac_address" "this" {
  mac_address                   = "00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E"
  virtual_machine_interface_id = netbox_interface.this.id
}
```

With `object_type` and `interface_id`:
```terraform
// Assuming a virtual machine with the id `123` exists
resource "netbox_interface" "this" {
  name               = "eth0"
  virtual_machine_id = 123
}

resource "netbox_mac_address" "this" {
  mac_address   = "00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E"
  interface_id = netbox_interface.this.id
  object_type  = "virtualization.vminterface"
}
```

### Creating a MAC address that is assigned to a device interface

With `device_interface_id`:
```terraform
// Assuming a device with the id `123` exists
resource "netbox_device_interface" "this" {
  name      = "eth0"
  device_id = 123
  type      = "1000base-t"
}

resource "netbox_mac_address" "this" {
  mac_address          = "00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E"
  device_interface_id = netbox_device_interface.this.id
}
```

With `object_type` and `interface_id`:
```terraform
// Assuming a device with the id `123` exists
resource "netbox_device_interface" "this" {
  name      = "eth0"
  device_id = 123
  type      = "1000base-t"
}

resource "netbox_mac_address" "this" {
  mac_address   = "00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E"
  interface_id = netbox_device_interface.this.id
  object_type  = "dcim.interface"
}
```

### Creating a MAC address that is not assigned to anything

You can create a MAC address that is not assigned to anything by omitting the attributes mentioned above.

```terraform
resource "netbox_mac_address" "this" {
  mac_address = "00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E"
}
```
