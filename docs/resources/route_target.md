  From the official documentation https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/models/ipam/routetarget/:
  A route target is a particular type of extended BGP community used to control the redistribution of routes among VRF tables in a network. Route targets can be assigned to individual VRFs in NetBox as import or export targets (or both) to model this exchange in an L3VPN. Each route target must be given a unique name, which should be in a format prescribed by RFC 4364, similar to a VR route distinguisher.
