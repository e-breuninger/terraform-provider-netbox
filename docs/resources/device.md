  From the official documentation https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/features/devices/#devices:
  Every piece of hardware which is installed within a site or rack exists in NetBox as a device. Devices are measured in rack units (U) and can be half depth or full depth. A device may have a height of 0U: These devices do not consume vertical rack space and cannot be assigned to a particular rack unit. A common example of a 0U device is a vertically-mounted PDU.

# netbox_device (Resource)

From the [official documentation](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/features/devices/#devices):

> Every piece of hardware which is installed within a site or rack exists in NetBox as a device. Devices are measured in rack units (U) and can be half depth or full depth. A device may have a height of 0U: These devices do not consume vertical rack space and cannot be assigned to a particular rack unit. A common example of a 0U device is a vertically-mounted PDU.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "netbox_site" "test" {
  name = "%[1]s"
}

resource "netbox_device_role" "test" {
  name      = "%[1]s"
  color_hex = "123456"
}

resource "netbox_manufacturer" "test" {
  name = "test"
}

resource "netbox_device_type" "test" {
  model           = "test"
  manufacturer_id = netbox_manufacturer.test.id
}

resource "netbox_device" "test" {
  name           = "%[1]s"
  device_type_id = netbox_device_type.test.id
  role_id        = netbox_device_role.test.id
  site_id        = netbox_site.test.id
  local_context_data = jsonencode({
    "setting_a" = "Some Setting"
    "setting_b" = 42
  })
}
