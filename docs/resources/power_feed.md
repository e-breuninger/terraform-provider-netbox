  From the official documentation https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/models/dcim/powerfeed/:
  A power feed represents the distribution of power from a power panel to a particular device, typically a power distribution unit (PDU). The power port (inlet) on a device can be connected via a cable to a power feed. A power feed may optionally be assigned to a rack to allow more easily tracking the distribution of power among racks.

# netbox_power_feed (Resource)

From the [official documentation](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/models/dcim/powerfeed/):

> A power feed represents the distribution of power from a power panel to a particular device, typically a power distribution unit (PDU). The power port (inlet) on a device can be connected via a cable to a power feed. A power feed may optionally be assigned to a rack to allow more easily tracking the distribution of power among racks.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "netbox_site" "test" {
  name   = "Site 1"
  status = "active"
}

resource "netbox_location" "test" {
  name    = "Location 1"
  site_id = netbox_site.test.id
}

resource "netbox_power_panel" "test" {
  name        = "Power Panel 1"
  site_id     = netbox_site.test.id
  location_id = netbox_location.test.id
}

resource "netbox_power_feed" "test" {
  power_panel_id          = netbox_power_panel.test.id
  name                    = "Power Feed 1"
  status                  = "active"
  type                    = "primary"
  supply                  = "ac"
  phase                   = "single-phase"
  voltage                 = 250
  amperage                = 100
  max_percent_utilization = 80
}
