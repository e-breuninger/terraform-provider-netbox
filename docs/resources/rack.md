  From the official documentation https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/models/dcim/rack/:
  The rack model represents a physical two- or four-post equipment rack in which devices can be installed. Each rack must be assigned to a site, and may optionally be assigned to a location within that site. Racks can also be organized by user-defined functional roles. The name and facility ID of each rack within a location must be unique.
  Rack height is measured in rack units (U); racks are commonly between 42U and 48U tall, but NetBox allows you to define racks of arbitrary height. A toggle is provided to indicate whether rack units are in ascending (from the ground up) or descending order.
  Each rack is assigned a name and (optionally) a separate facility ID. This is helpful when leasing space in a data center your organization does not own: The facility will often assign a seemingly arbitrary ID to a rack (for example, "M204.313") whereas internally you refer to is simply as "R113." A unique serial number and asset tag may also be associated with each rack.

# netbox_rack (Resource)

From the [official documentation](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/models/dcim/rack/):

> The rack model represents a physical two- or four-post equipment rack in which devices can be installed. Each rack must be assigned to a site, and may optionally be assigned to a location within that site. Racks can also be organized by user-defined functional roles.

Rack height is measured in rack units (U); racks are commonly between 42U and 48U tall, but NetBox allows you to define racks of arbitrary height. A toggle is provided to indicate whether rack units are in ascending (from the ground up) or descending order.

Each rack is assigned a name and (optionally) a separate facility ID. This is helpful when leasing space in a data center your organization does not own: The facility will often assign a seemingly arbitrary ID to a rack (for example, "M204.313") whereas internally you refer to is simply as "R113." A unique serial number and asset tag may also be associated with each rack.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "netbox_site" "test" {
  name   = "test"
  status = "active"
}

resource "netbox_rack" "test" {
  name     = "test"
  site_id  = netbox_site.test.id
  status   = "reserved"
  width    = 19
  u_height = 48
}
```
